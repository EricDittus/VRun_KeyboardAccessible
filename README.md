Description:
VRun is a VR integrated running game where the main character is an Alien visiting Earth for a bit of peace and tranquility (and perhaps an abductee or two), but quickly discovers the dangers of Planet Earth and must flee to return Home.

  
Playing Controls:
a : left turn
d : right turn
space bar : jump
*note: by going into the AlienAnimationStateController.c and AlienScriptMars.c files and uncommenting implementation for sliding, you can also use "s" to slide, but implementation is imperfect
